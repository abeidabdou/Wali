I am a bot created for the sole purpose of keeping your server safe, which means that I can only do moderation work, so if you ask me anything else, I won't be able to help you.\n\n2. To find out everything I can do for you, read the documentation\n\n3. Anyone you give access to any of my features will not have access to any of my private channels unless you specifically give them access to these channels.\n\n4. Don't be lazy, read the Doc-channel, even if only a small part.",
